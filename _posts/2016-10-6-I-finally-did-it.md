# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Complete

8 months and one relationship later, I finally completed the *last* project from the Udacity FEND program. It's been an uphill struggle for multiple reasons, the most being that it's very difficult to make sure to continue to write code every day

### Lesson 1: Don't Break the Chain

I got into web design and development because I was excited by the idea that a couple lines of semi-legible English could make the computer dance for me. Now I understand a little bit more of the magic and it's becoming far easier for me to imagine myself in an engineering role. The hardest aspect of this nanodegree was to continue to work a little bit on it at a time. As a person who regularly wants to finish everything today or if not today, right-fragging-now, I was frustrated at myself for not being more compassionate to the learning experience.

Obviously, that frustration made me put myself down, and it delayed my graduation. The takeaway is to keep making little efforts to create something bigger than yourself.

### Lesson 2: You are not alone, so stop being so lonely

It was tough for me to not feel separated as the very nature of the nanodegree is online and therefore abstracted from human interaction. This was foolish, particularly because on any given day of the week, the entire Bay Area has a meetup or a meeting somewhere
