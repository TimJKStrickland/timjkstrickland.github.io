The biggest reason I went to Udacity in the first place is because I suffer from decision paralysis in the worst way. I love to talk about VR, AR, JavaScript, web technologies, new build systems, machine learning, and the list goes *on* and *on*. It's always been an issue that it's not that I can't focus but that I can't focus on a single task. How does anyone focus on one single thing at a time?

It only takes a few conversations with someone truly happy with where they are to realize that modern society finds happiness kind of boring. And it should be! Happiness can be categorized as an understanding that if you like yourself and you like what you do professionally or otherwise, you don't necessarily have to change. I wish I could count how many times I've heard the phrase "I'm happy with how things are right now" but it happens less often than you might think. Think back to the time that you last thought, "Man, I am happy right now. This is exactly what I like."
