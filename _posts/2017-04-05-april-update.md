## Iguanas, everywhere

Second cohort has been a positive experience.

## Back End voting app

I'm cruising through the back end projects a little more quickly than I had thought that they would take me.The best part is that I haven't really had to stop on these. The microstamp collector  was a lot easier to assemble than I had thought. I am on track to actually finish the back end certificate fairly shortly which is __awesome__. I used to be afraid of Express apps and how to integrate everything together but it's making more sense more frequently.

## Front End Certificate

In March I started to refocus my efforts on finally finishing the Front End certificate for the FCC. It's not that it's hard but like all projects you get excited aboutdifferent aspects of the code or code base. Somethinmes you're not excited at all, and you just need to pull the teeth. The local weather app and the WIki app are definitely two that fall into that category. The twitch API should be pretty straightforward , but I need to read the documentation and that's what this weekend is for.

### Qué más?

Actually not much more is going on. I'm burning the midnight+ oil to try and do more of these projects underway, so I cna be more readily appilcable to the market. I did have a prety good interview wbut that take home exam murdered me. PostgreSQL integration will be a good asset to bring out but I have to figure out what about the backend service wasn't working and why.It did bum me out that I couldn't get further with it than I did, but this is a lesson in time managenet. I spent several days just trying to figure out the api and read all the files. From the getgo it will serve me better to chunk out the problems and make the mmore actionable. Projects are not insurmountbale, but they do take palnning and they do take time.

I'm still thinking about getting a car, liekly a CRV. .. But that's a non-sequitur.
