## Lazy weekend

Didn't do squat, but it felt good because I've been burning it at both ends for a few weeks. I'll likely go back at it after I come back from Del Valle.

## Speed Run!

I've kept the [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com) certificates on the back burner while I've been looking for a job, but now I can't stand not having finished either. I feel like Ben Affleck's character in The Accountant.

## Giffin' plans

I'm also working on a few different things. I want to start making a SPA of a gif maker because of a few things:

1. I'm tired of Gif Keyboard not being as reliable as it once was, and
2. gif's make me happy.

The project starts in the brainstorming area today
